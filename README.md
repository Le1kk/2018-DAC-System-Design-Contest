# 2018-DAC-System-Design-Contest
# Overview
The 2018 System Design Contest features embedded system implementation of neural network based object detection for drones. Contestants will receive training dataset provided by our industry sponsor DJI, and a hidden dataset will be used to evaluate the performance of the designs in terms of accuracy and power. Contestants will compete in two different categories: FPGA and GPU, and grand cash awards will be given to the top three teams in each category. In addition, our industry sponsor Xilinx and Nvidia will provide a limited number of teams successfully registered with a free design kit (on a first-come-first-served basis). The award ceremony will be held at 2018 IEEE/ACM Design Automation Conference.
